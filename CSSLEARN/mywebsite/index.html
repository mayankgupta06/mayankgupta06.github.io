<p>There are several things to consider in order to help your book achieve its greatest potential discoverability. Readers, librarians, and retailers can't purchase a book they can't find, and your book metadata is responsible for whether or not your book pops up when they type in search terms relevant to your book. Book metadata may sound complicated, but it consists of all the information that describes your book, including: your title, subtitle, series name, price, trim size, author name, book description, and more. There are two metadata fields for your book description: the long book description and the short book description. Although both play a role in driving traffic to your book, they have distinct differences.</p>
